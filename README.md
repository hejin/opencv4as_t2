# opencv4as_t2
almost the same as opencv4as but using openCV 3.4.1

NOTE:
* the tutorial-2 in samples directory of openCV SDK 2.4.13.x doesnt work anymore for the changes of feature detector related APIs in openCV 3.x. So here I simplely replaced the FastFeatureDetector detector(50) to FAST(mGr, v, 50). However the tutorial-2 sample code in openCV 3.x has already made necessary modifications.
